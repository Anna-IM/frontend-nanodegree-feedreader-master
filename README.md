# Project Overview

In this project are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I come in, I should test the project.


## What I've learned?

*How to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. The tests helped me to understand better the logic of the event handling and DOM manipulation.


# How I worked on this project?


1. Followed the JavaScript Testing [course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud549)
2. Reviewed the functionality of the application within my browser.
3. Explored the application's HTML (**./index.html**), CSS (**./css/style.css**) and JavaScript (**./js/app.js**) to gain an understanding of how it works.
4. Explored the Jasmine spec file in **./jasmine/spec/feedreader.js** and review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io).
5. Wrote tests upon the fields **"TO DO"**.
6. Read about Jasmine function testing in: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jasmine), [Jasmine Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jasminejs/index.htm), [Code Review](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/32573/spyon-click-events-and-check-call-function), [AngularJS](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing#jasmine), etc.
